# Northern Powergrid Future Energy Scenarios

Northern Powergrid's potential future scenarios as defined in the National Grid Future Energy Scenarios.


## About the visualisation

### Predictions

Each modelled parameter is calculated by Element Energy for each of Northern Powergrid's Primary Supply Points.


### Geographies

For this visualisation we have created geographies (polygons) for each Primary Supply Point in Northern Powergrid's network. We chose to use Output Areas (2011) as these are the building blocks of census geography as used by the Office of National Statistics. We have used Northern Powergrid customer postcodes to identify each Output Area supplied by each Primary Supply Point. Output Areas with fewer than 10 customers connected to a Primary were excluded. This helped with anonymisation and also reduced data issues in the customer database e.g. incorrect customer postcodes. We construct representative geographies for each Primary Supply Point from the remaining Output Areas. In cases where multiple Primary Supply Points serve the same Output Area, that Output Area is assigned to the Primary Supply Point that serves the most customers there.

Some Primary Supply Point geographies may show larger areas on the map than they cover in practice particularly in rural areas where network connectivity may be concentrated in specific parts of an Output Area. The areas shown here are representative for the purpose of showing the Future Energy Scenario model data and should not be relied upon for checking connectivity or to assess the terms of connection for specific premises.

### Local Authority view

The model predictions have been created by Primary Supply Point and that is the definitive view. The Local Authority view is constructed from the Primary Supply Point values. We have found the proportion of a Primary Supply Point's customers in each Local Authority District (as defined in April 2019) by adding up the customers in each Output Area belonging to a specific Local Authority District. For some parameters (e.g. electric vehicles) the values from the Primary Supply Points are apportioned to each Local Authority District and then summed into totals. For values which can't be summed (e.g. Peak demand) we have shown the maximum value for any Primary Supply Point that serves a Local Authority.
