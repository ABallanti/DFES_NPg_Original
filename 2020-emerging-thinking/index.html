			<h2>About this visualisation</h2>
			<h3>Emerging Thinking 2020</h3>
			<p>In August and September 2020 we have shared our emerging views on the business plan <a href="http://engage.northernpowergrid.com/planning-for-2023-28/welcome"</a> that we are preparing to submit in 2021 in line with Ofgem’s price control period 2023-28. A huge part of this planning is the work we are doing to prepare for the UK Government’s target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
			<p>As part of our planning for decarbonisation we have considered a range of possible pathways that the country could take to get to net zero by 2050, in order to determine what action we need to take in 2023-28. With low carbon energy consultants Element Energy we have created our Emerging Thinking net zero scenarios using bottom-up “building blocks” – key elements of energy generation and consumption that make up the UK’s energy market and how this will change in order to decarbonise in the future. These building blocks can broadly be split into three key categories: heat, transport, and generation and storage. For the scenarios we have modelled we have made assumptions about the volume and rate of usage of each of the building blocks to form a view about how decarbonisation will practically be achieved under different pathways.</p>
			<p>We’re publishing here our modelling results for our stakeholders to review and comment upon. The three scenarios are:</p>
 			<ol>
				<li>Deep Electrification - an electrification of heat pathway which meets Net Zero by 2050;</li>
				<li>High Hydrogen - a hydrogen heat pathway which meets Net Zero by 2050;</li>
				<li>Early Net Zero - a hybrid pathway which attempts to meet net zero before 2050 by accelerating the uptake of Electric Vehicles and Electric Heat Pumps in the early years where these are the main technologies available, and in later years making some use too of Hydrogen via hybrid heat pumps.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Predictions</h3>
			<p></p>
			<p>These scenarios represent different possible future worlds but should not be used as a prescriptive forecast; Northern Powergrid and Element Energy accept no responsibility for the use of this data.</p>
			<h3>Geographies</h3>
			<p>For this visualisation <a href="https://odileeds.org/blog/2019-11-27-building-electricity-distribution-geography">we have created</a> <a href="data/maps/primaries-unique.geojson">geographies (polygons) for each Primary substation</a> in Northern Powergrid's network. We chose to use <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2001censusandearlier/dataandproducts/outputgeography/outputareas">Output Areas</a> (2011) as these are the building blocks of census geography as used by the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office of National Statistics</a>. We have used customer postcodes to identify each Output Area supplied by each Primary substation. Output Areas with fewer than 10 customers connected to a Primary substation were excluded. This helped with anonymisation and also reduced data issues in the customer database e.g. incorrect customer postcodes. We construct representative geographies for each Primary substation from the remaining Output Areas. In cases where multiple Primary substations serve the same Output Area, that Output Area is assigned to the Primary substation that serves the most customers there.</p>
			<p>Some Primary substation geographies may show larger areas on the map than they cover in practice particularly in rural areas where network connectivity may be concentrated in specific parts of an Output Area. The areas shown here are representative for the purpose of showing the Future Energy Scenario model data and should not be relied upon for checking connectivity or to assess the terms of connection for specific premises.</p>
			<h3>Local Authority view</h3>
			<p>The model predictions have been created by Primary substation and that is the definitive view. The Local Authority view is constructed from the Primary substation values. We have found the proportion of a Primary substation's customers in each Local Authority district (as defined in April 2019) by adding up the customers in each Output Area belonging to a specific Local Authority district. For some parameters (e.g. electric vehicles) the values from the Primary substations are apportioned to each Local Authority District and then summated into totals. For values which can't be summated (e.g. Peak demand) we have shown the maximum value for any Primary substation that serves a Local Authority. For Local Authorities which are only partially in Northern Powergrid areas the model only produces forecasts for the area served by Northern Powergrid, so it is not a total Local Authority forecast. Examples of these Local Authorities partially served by Northern Powergrid include Bassetlaw, East Lindsey, High Peak, North East Derbyshire, North East Lincolnshire, North Lincolnshire, Pendle, West Lindsey. There are some additional major sites situated within a Local Authority area which distribute into many Local Authority areas and which may have further direct connections for large wind, solar and other generation. Data for these Grid Supply Points (connection points between the GB transmission network and Northern Powergrid’s distribution network) and Bulk Supply Points (connection points on NPg's network which are fed from the Grid Supply Points and supply the primary substations) can also be downloaded from Data Mill North. </p>
