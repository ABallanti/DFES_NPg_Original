## About this visualisation

### Emerging Thinking 2020

To support our Emerging Thinking document (a link will be made available once published) as part of the RIIO-ED2 business plan process, we have developed this new set of scenarios that provides headline costs and specified outcomes that support net zero decarbonisation pathways. We look forward to the publication of NG FES 2020 in July where Net Zero targets will be met and we will make use of those in DFES 2020 along with incorporating stakeholder feedback. However the NG FES 2019 does not meet Net Zero targets and only achieves an 80% reduction based on the previous target. Therefore for our emerging thinking, in which we need to understand the implications of possible future energy pathways for our network and our network investment requirements, we have looked ourselves at ways of meeting Net Zero.

To achieve this we have employed the help of Element Energy, made use of national reports such as the Committee for Climate Change report (LINK), and consulted with technical experts in our own region. In consequence we publish here our own three new Emerging Thinking Net Zero Scenarios. These are all characterised by the electrification of transport, the use of solely decarbonised generation, and the removal of all natural gas heating, including CHP in order to meet Net Zero by 2050 at the latest. The three scenarios are:

1. Deep Electrification - an electrification of heat pathway which meets Net Zero by 2050;
2. High Hydrogen - a hydrogen heat pathway which meets Net Zero by 2050;
3. Early Net Zero - a hybrid pathway which attempts to meet net zero before 2050 by accelerating the uptake of Electric Vehicles and Electric Heat Pumps in the early years where these are the main technologies available, and in later years making some use too of Hydrogen via hybrid heat pumps.

### Predictions

These scenarios represent different possible future worlds but should not be used as a prescriptive forecast; Northern Powergrid and Element Energy accept no responsibility for the use of this data.

### Geographies

For this visualisation [we have created](https://odileeds.org/blog/2019-11-27-building-electricity-distribution-geography) [geographies (polygons) for each Primary substation](https://odileeds.github.io/northern-powergrid/2020-emerging-thinking/data/maps/primaries-unique.geojson) in Northern Powergrid's network. We chose to use [Output Areas](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2001censusandearlier/dataandproducts/outputgeography/outputareas) (2011) as these are the building blocks of census geography as used by the [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/). We have used customer postcodes to identify each Output Area supplied by each Primary substation. Output Areas with fewer than 10 customers connected to a Primary substation were excluded. This helped with anonymisation and also reduced data issues in the customer database e.g. incorrect customer postcodes. We construct representative geographies for each Primary substation from the remaining Output Areas. In cases where multiple Primary substations serve the same Output Area, that Output Area is assigned to the Primary substation that serves the most customers there.

Some Primary substation geographies may show larger areas on the map than they cover in practice particularly in rural areas where network connectivity may be concentrated in specific parts of an Output Area. The areas shown here are representative for the purpose of showing the Future Energy Scenario model data and should not be relied upon for checking connectivity or to assess the terms of connection for specific premises.

### Local Authority view

The model predictions have been created by Primary substation and that is the definitive view. The Local Authority view is constructed from the Primary substation values. We have found the proportion of a Primary substation's customers in each Local Authority district (as defined in April 2019) by adding up the customers in each Output Area belonging to a specific Local Authority district. For some parameters (e.g. electric vehicles) the values from the Primary substations are apportioned to each Local Authority District and then summated into totals. For values which can't be summated (e.g. Peak demand) we have shown the maximum value for any Primary substation that serves a Local Authority. For Local Authorities which are only partially in Northern Powergrid areas the model only produces forecasts for the area served by Northern Powergrid, so it is not a total Local Authority forecast. Examples of these Local Authorities partially served by Northern Powergrid include Bassetlaw, East Lindsey, High Peak, North East Derbyshire, North East Lincolnshire, North Lincolnshire, Pendle, West Lindsey. There are some additional major sites situated within a Local Authority area which distribute into many Local Authority areas and which may have further direct connections for large wind, solar and other generation. Data for these Grid Supply Points (connection points between the GB transmission network and Northern Powergridâ€™s distribution network) and Bulk Supply Points (connection points on NPg's network which are fed from the Grid Supply Points and supply the primary substations) can also be downloaded from Data Mill North.
Data

[DFES 2019 data files can be found on Data Mill North](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/northern-powergrid-dfes) (and [in this repository](../2019-DFES/data/scenarios/primaries/)) and the [2020 Emerging Thinking data files can be found in this repository](data/scenarios/primaries/). The Primary substation data files that power this visualisation are stored with this repository on Github.
